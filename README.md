# FlashCardApp
  
This is a flash card app I created for Android. The user can add cards they want to create. When they push save it adds it to the Room database. When the user clicks edit it pulls up the card they are looking at, and they can change the information found on the card then push save. When that happens the card gets updated. The decks button doesn't do anything right now, but I would like to add seperate decks in the future, so you have more organization in what you study.  
  
The bottom bar gets updated when you add a card. The blue numbers are the amount of new cards. The red cards are the number of studying cards. And the green cards are the amount of old cards that you need to study.  
  
When you have a card to study the term will only appear. When you click on the screen you will be given the answer, and you will have two options: Again or Good. If you press again and it is a new card or old card, it will be placed in the studying section. If you press good and it is a studying card or old card, then it will be removed. If you press good and it is a new card it will be placed in the studying deck. (I wanted it so you have to study it atleast twice if it is a new card.)  
  
The cards will be refreshed every day, so you can study them again.
